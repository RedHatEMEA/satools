  "guide": "<h1>Forms</h1>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>Along with Grids, Forms are used in almost every <a href=\"#/api/Ext\" rel=\"Ext\" class=\"docClass\">Ext</a> JS application. In version 3 we were a little constrained by the FormLayout, which made it difficult to get a form looking just right. <a href=\"#/api/Ext\" rel=\"Ext\" class=\"docClass\">Ext</a> JS 4 removes the need for FormLayout altogether, enabling you to use any layout imaginable with your forms. Forms are also no longer tied to the DOM, making it easier than ever to have forms spanning multiple tabs without problems.</p>\n\n<p>With the addition of the new FieldLayout, any component can be placed into a form and given a label and even error messages. Because the definition of a Field has been moved into a Mixin, you can add a grid, tree or other component into a form and use it as a multi select.</p>\n"
